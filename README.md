Simple PHP code to create Slash command to use with ChatGPT

Here's a general overview of the steps you'll need to follow:

Set up a Mattermost bot account: 
You can create a new bot account in your Mattermost instance by going to the "System Console" > "Integrations" > "Bot Accounts" and clicking "Add Bot Account". 
Follow the instructions to create a new bot account with a username, display name, and profile picture.

Create a custom slash command: 
In Mattermost, you can create a custom slash command that will trigger your bot when a user types it in a channel. To create a new slash command, go to the "System Console" > "Integrations" > "Slash Commands" and click "Add Slash Command". 
Set the command trigger to something like "/mybot" and set the request URL to the URL of your web server where you will receive the message.

Write a PHP script to handle incoming messages: 
On your web server, write a PHP script that will handle incoming messages from Mattermost. You can use the Mattermost API to parse the message payload and extract the relevant information. 
Once you have the message content, you can process it however you like (e.g. send it to a database, perform some calculations, etc.) and then use the Mattermost API to post a response back to the channel where the slash command was triggered.

Set up your web server to receive requests: 
Finally, you'll need to set up your web server to receive incoming requests from Mattermost. You can use a web framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to your PHP script.

Note: Replace "https://your-mattermost-url.com" with the URL of your Mattermost instance, and replace "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" with a valid access token for your bot account. 
and replace OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token you get from openai.

You can generate an access token in the Mattermost web UI by going to "Account Settings" > "Security" > "Personal Access Tokens".
